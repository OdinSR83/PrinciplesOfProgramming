1) Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan.

2) Add the potatoes and onions and fry, stirring often, for about 15’, until golden brown.

3) Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool a little, then take the potatoes and onions out of the oil with a slotted spoon.

4) Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add the potatoes and onions and season well with salt.

5) Heat a little olive oil in a 20cm diameter frying pan, preferably non-stick.

6) Add the egg mixture and cook over a medium heat until it is just beginning to set – about 5 minutes.

7) Place a large plate over the frying pan and carefully tip both plate and pan over so that the tortilla ends up on the plate, cooked side up.

8) Slide the tortilla back into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes.

9) Repeat the procedure twice more, cooking for another 5 minutes or so on each side. The tortilla should still be a little bit runny in the middle.
